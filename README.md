# E-HealthCare-Management
Mini Project on E-HealthCare Management

The E-Health Care Management System represents a comprehensive web-based application meticulously designed to bridge the existing gap between patients and healthcare professionals. This bridging is particularly crucial during unprecedented situations, such as the recent COVID-19 pandemic, which underscored the rising need for remote medical consultations.  The system facilitates virtual interactions between doctors and patients through a secure and user-friendly interface, enabling patients to register, describe their symptoms, and receive medical consultations or prescriptions without the necessity of physical visits.

Concurrently, healthcare providers, including doctors, can efficiently manage appointments, access and review patient records, and offer timely medical advice. Hospitals, as key stakeholders, benefit from the system's ability to register and manage critical data related to available beds and admitted patients, which significantly improves operational efficiency and resource allocation, especially during periods of high demand or public health crises.

The system is developed using a robust technology stack, including Java, Tailwind, HTTP server and Supabase, adhering to a well-defined Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern. This architectural choice ensures data consistency, secure access control, and inherent scalability, allowing for future enhancements such as integrated video consultations and seamless prescription downloads. The underlying database meticulously tracks user registrations, comprehensive hospital data, and real-time bed availability, which is instrumental in effective pandemic management and broader resource optimization.

By digitizing essential healthcare functions, the E-Health Care Management System aims to reduce unnecessary hospital visits for minor illnesses, thereby promoting a safer and more contactless healthcare environment. Ultimately, this project endeavors to enhance healthcare accessibility for a wider population, streamline complex hospital workflows, and provide patients with timely and reliable medical support from the safety and comfort of their homes.
